what to consider (further):
1. rotation[have to consider, because shoooting gun could only aim at 180 degrees forward]
2. hit rate ()
3. speed (it might affect hit rate?)
4. 'shooted' might be represented as integers as speed of bullets should be much higher than that of robots.

INFO:
* projectile frequency limit: 10Hz
* projectile speed limit: 20m/s 
* initial HP for each robot: 2000
* [VERIFICATION NEEDED] size of robots: 0.5m*0.5m
* [VERIFICATION NEEDED] size of bonus detecting module: 0.1m*0.1m
* [VERIFICATION NEEDED] shift from robot center to bonus detecting module center: [0, 10cm]
* [VERIFICATION NEEDED] whether shifting is allowed for RFID module
* [VERIFICATION NEEDED] might be slope on the edge of bonus zone
* size of bonus zone: 0.5m*0.5m
* challenge round: 180s
* max number of projectile: 200
* each projectile hit reduces 50HP. 
* when bonus detecting module reside in bonus area for 5s, projectile hit from all team robots reduces 75HP
* score calculation: Score = a*X + b*Y - c*Z.
	a = 6.0/( 4.0 + ROBOT_NUM)
	b = 75.0/( 4.0 + ROBOT_NUM)
	c = 2.0/( 1.0 + ROBOT_NUM)
	X: HP reduction of AI robots
	Y: remaining time (in seconds) when both AI robots are destroyed (or 0 if not destroyed)
	Z: HP reduction of team robots

for environment:
1. [HIGH][[Yelly finished]] Collision detection.
	Once collision detected, give the agent negative reward.
	The reward is almost unbearable in the case of colliding into the wall (including outbound wall).
	When collide into other robots (either friend or opponent), the reward is given according to real-world consequences.
2. [HIGH][Yelly finished information store and update, but corresponding reward remains for next step] buff, HP, projectile
3. [HIGH][Yelly did it in a naive way, URGENTLY needs further discussion] explore the equation of reward relating to HP and moving. 
	// below commentted out if the case is considered in end case...
	//Special reward needed for winning the game by shooting all AI robots to 0,
	//as well as losing the game as self HP to 0.
4. [MEDIUM][Yelly finished] more than one robot shoot at one robot
5. [MEDIUM][Yelly finished] one robot could only shoot one robot at a time
6. [MEDIUM][dismissed][vision module and control module have to ensure that the gun always aim at opponent robot if it's insight] rotation consideration
7. [LOW] add the information of whether a robot died. Consider the case in which one of the two robots die
8. [LOW] compute the real location after action is taken (I wonder if the robot can actually move to exact place as the action persumes)
9. [LOW] corner cases specifing, including collision.
10. [LOW] hit rate consideration
11. [LOW] SHOOTING DELAY.  calculate the time since shooting action decided till the first projectile hit armor module (might have to take whether last action is shooting into consideration). Compute frequency function.

further discussion:
1. how about input specific info only, rather than the img?
	notice that for now the input is the inital map and never change!
2. add info: projectile, opponent dead representation
3. should we consider rotation(action) when it comes to RFID module? Do we have the information of whether the RFID module is recognized by the bonus zone in real match?
4. we're only giving the (supposed to be ) optimal action a corresponding reward while setting other actions rewards as zero, then we'll never know what will happen if taking other actions. There might be better solutions nevertheless.
5. We're assuming movement on X axis, movement on Y axis, and shooting as three independent actions. If we calculate reward for suboptimal actions, i.e. discussion [4] solved, should we compute the integeration of reward for each of the action upon all other action axis?
6. agent should know which robots are dead - could be implemented by using different color in input map, or add a element representing liveness if input is pure info-vector.
